num1 = input("Give me a number: ")
num2 = input("Give me another!")
print("I'll add them for you!")
print(num1 + num2)



### What was wrong ?
### DISCUSS HERE:
### forgot int , so it would add the two strings instead of adding integers for example 3 + 4 would make 34
### Was this a... syntax, logical or runtime error?

#logical error
